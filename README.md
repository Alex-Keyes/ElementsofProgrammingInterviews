## Elements of Programming Interviews

This repo is intended as a guide for engineers looking to prepare for technical interviews.  Based off the excellent
  Elements of Programming Interviews, this guide is also going to contain my personal insight into what I've seen and
  done for tech interview preparation.  Additionally I wanted to create a resource to extend the great information available in
  the text.  Look for a 'cheat sheet' based off the boot camp sections at the start of each
  chapter as well as code solutions for the problems asked in each section.   
    
    
While there are a plethora of great guides out there, I wanted to write something that would help me and hopefully 
  provide a guide to people who aren't as enthused with Leetcode or InterviewBit and would like more prep than just
  tech questions, asked in a vacuum without information on how to improve or consider the problem at hand.

## Installation

You can install this repo by cloning it: 
`git clone https://github.com/Alex-Keyes/ElementsofProgrammingInterviews `

after that I haven't decided if I should include a CMAKE or not.  Any thoughts?
